#To Do

- Combat simulator
  - ~~Must allow for multi-way combat~~
  - ~~Must allow multiple offensive combatants to avoid "ghosting"~~
  - ~~Must display losses~~
- ~~Political outcome calculator~~
- Random dice roll/number generator
- Rules and about page
- Still need to fix the "submit" button on battle page to make sure it validates the required fields
